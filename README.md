A secure healthcare appointment management system developed with a security-first approach, demonstrating comprehensive implementation of secure design principles and best practices in web application security.

## üîê Security Highlights

This project showcases my expertise in secure application development and cybersecurity best practices:

### Security Implementations
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered security architecture with authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation**: Designed to protect against common vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforcement with HSTS headers
- **Password Security**: PBKDF2 hashing with salting for secure credential storage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client and server-side validation
- **Secure Session Management**: Cookie-based authentication with HttpOnly flags

### Security Testing & Validation
- **OWASP ZAP Scan**: Achieved zero critical vulnerabilities
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: A+ rating on SSL Labs test
- **GDPR Compliance**: Cookie management and data protection compliance
- **Penetration Testing**: Successfully defended against:
  - SQL Injection attacks
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - HTTP Downgrade attacks

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Security-Focused Design
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication Layer   # ASP.NET Identity with custom user management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authorization Layer    # Role-based access control (RBAC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Protection        # Entity Framework with parameterized queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Security           # Secure RESTful endpoints with anti-forgery tokens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Audit & Logging        # Comprehensive activity tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cloud Security         # Azure WAF and security configurations
```

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0, C# 12.0
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server with encrypted connections
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core (preventing SQL injection)
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Cloud**: Microsoft Azure with WAF protection
- **Frontend Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS protection

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Features

### 1. **Multi-Factor Access Control**
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Doctor, Patient, Caregiver)
- Granular access controls for sensitive operations
- Session timeout and sliding expiration

### 2. **Data Protection**
- Encrypted data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure API endpoints with CSRF protection

### 3. **Audit Trail**
- User activity logging
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Appointment modification history

### 4. **Compliance & Standards**
- GDPR compliant data handling
- Healthcare data protection standards
- Secure coding practices following OWASP guidelines
